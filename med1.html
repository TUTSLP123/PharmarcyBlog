    <h4 style="text-align:center;text-decoration:underline"> What is Benadryl?</h4>
  </br>

              <p>    Benadryl (diphenhydramine) is an antihistamine that reduces the effects of natural
                     chemical histamine in the body. Histamine can produce symptoms of sneezing,
                     itching, watery eyes, and runny nose.
                    Benadryl is used to treat sneezing, runny nose, watery eyes, hives, skin rash,
                    itching, and other cold or allergy symptoms.

                    Benadryl is also used to treat motion sickness, to induce sleep, and to treat certain
                    symptoms of Parkinson's disease.</p>
  </br>
              <h4 style="text-align:center">Important information</h4>
              <p>   You should not use Benadryl to make a child sleepy.
                    When taking Benadryl, use caution driving, operating machinery, or performing
                    other hazardous activities. Diphenhydramine may cause dizziness or drowsiness. If you
                    experience dizziness or drowsiness, avoid these activities.
                    Use alcohol cautiously. Alcohol may increase drowsiness and dizziness while taking Benadryl.
                   Do not give this medication to a child younger than 2 years old. Always ask a doctor before
                   giving a cough or cold medicine to a child. Death can occur from the misuse of cough and cold medicines in very
                   young children.</p>
