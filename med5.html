    <h4 style="text-decoration:underline">  What is Calpol used for?</h4>
          <p>Calpol products contain children's doses of paracetamol.
            Calpol can be given to children for the following reasons:

            <ul>
             <li>Relieving mild to moderate pain such as headache,
               toothache, teething, earache or sore throat.</li>
            <li>Reducing a high temperature (fever).</li>
            <li>Relieving aches, pains, fever and general discomfort
              associated with colds and flu or following childhood
              vaccinations.</li>
            </ul>
          </P>

        </br>

       <h4 style="text-align:center;text-decoration:underline">How does Calpol work?</h4>
        <p>Calpol contains the active ingredient paracetamol.

        Paracetamol is thought to relieve pain by reducing the production of prostaglandins in the brain and spinal cord.

        Prostaglandins are produced by the body in response to injury and certain diseases. One of their actions is to
        sensitise nerve endings, so that when that area is stimulated it causes pain (presumably to prevent us from
        causing further harm to the area). As paracetamol reduces the production of these nerve sensitising prostaglandins
        it is thought it may increase our pain threshold, so that although the cause of the pain remains, we can feel it less.

        Paracetamol reduces fever by affecting an area of the brain that regulates our body temperature
        (the hypothalamic heat-regulating center).</p>

      <h4 style="text-align:center;text-decoration:underline">What should I know before giving my child Calpol?</h4>
           <p>
             <ul>
               <li>Different preparations of Calpol are suitable for children of different ages.
             Make sure you use the correct preparation and dose for your child. Calpol fastmelts
             and Calpol six plus suspension are not suitable for children under six years of age.</li>
            <li>Calpol must not be given with any other medicines that contain paracetamol, as this can
              easily result in exceeding the recommended dose of paracetamol.</li>
           <li>An overdose of paracetamol is dangerous and capable of
             causing serious damage to the liver and kidneys.
             You should never exceed the dose stated in the information
             leaflet supplied with the medicine. Get immediate medical advice
             in the event of an overdose with Calpol, even if your child seems
             well, because of the risk of delayed, serious liver damage.</li>
           </p>

           <h4 style="text-align:center;text-decoration:underline">How do I give Calpol?</h4>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Calpol can be given either with or without food.</li>
    <li>Always follow the instructions given on the packaging of Calpol
      products regarding how much of the medicine to give and how
      often to give it. This will depend on the strength of
      the medicine and the age of your child.</li>
    <li>Each dose of Calpol suspension should be measured using a
    measuring spoon or an oral syringe. Never use an ordinary
    teaspoon to measure a dose of paracetamol. This is not accurate
     and can lead to your child being given too little or too much medicine.</li>
    <li>Bottles of Calpol suspension should be shaken before measuring a dose.</li>
   <li>Calpol Fastmelts are tablets that melt on the tongue to form a paste
      that can be swallowed without a drink, although these tablets can also
     be dispersed in a teaspoonful of water or milk if your child prefers.</li>
   <li>Do not give this medicine to your child for more than three days without
    getting medical advice from your doctor or pharmacist.
    For children under six months, get medical advice after 24
    hours use if their symptoms persist.</li>
