      <h2 style="text-align:center;text-decoration:underline">Safety information.</h2>

      <p>This product contains paracetamol which may be fatal in overdose.
        In the event of overdosage or suspected overdose and notwithstanding the fact that the person may be asymptomatic, the nearest doctor, hospital or Poison Centre must be contacted immediately.
        Dosages in excess of those recommended may cause severe liver damage.
        Patients suffering from liver or kidney disease should take paracetamol under
        medical supervision. Do not use continuously for more than 10 days without consulting a
        doctor. Consult a doctor if no relief is obtained from the recommended dosage.
        Store in a safe place out of reach of children.</p>
      </br>

       <h4 style="text-align:center;text-decoration:underline">KNOWN SYMPTOMS OF OVERDOSAGE AND PARTICULARS OF ITS TREATMENT:<sup>6</sup></h4>
              <p>Prompt treatment is essential. In the event of an overdosage,
                consult a doctor immediately, or take the person directly to a
                hospital. A delay in starting treatment may mean that antidote
                is given too late to be effective. Evidence of liver damage is
                often delayed until after the time for effective treatment has
                lapsed. Susceptibility to paracetamol toxicity is increased in
                patients who have taken repeated high doses
                (greater than 5 -10 g/day) of paracetamol for several days,
                in chronic alcoholism, chronic liver disease, AIDS, malnutrition,
                and with the use of drugs that induce liver microsomal oxidation such as barbiturates,
                isoniazid, rifampicin, phenytoin and carbamazepine. Symptoms of paracetamol overdosage in the
                first 24 hours include pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and possibly
                abdominal pain. Mild symptoms during the first two days of acute poisoning,
                do not reflect the potential seriousness of the overdosage.</p>
