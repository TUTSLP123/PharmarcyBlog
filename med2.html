       <h4 style="text-align:center;text-decoration:underline;">What Is Gripe Water?</h4>
       <p>Gripe water is an over-the-counter liquid supplement of sodium
         bicarbonate and herbs (such as fennel, ginger, chamomile, cardamom,
         licorice, cinnamon, clove, dill, lemon balm or peppermint, depending on
         the formula). In addition to soothing gas pains and other stomach
         problems, it’s also marketed as a remedy for teething pain, hiccups and
         sometimes even colic, among other ailments.</p>

       </br>

       <h4 style="text-align:center;text-decoration:underline;">How Does Gripe Water Work?</h4>
        <p>The original gripe water, first used by nannies and moms in England
          in the 1850s, contained alcohol — which people used to think relaxed
          babies (now we know that giving any alcohol to a baby can be toxic).
          These days, believers say some of the ingredients in certain gripe
          water formulas like dill, licorice, fennel and ginger can help relieve
          gas and stomach discomfort (and in turn may be beneficial for infants
          with colic, which is thought to be caused at least in part by gas).
          Some experts think gripe water might be effective at soothing fussy
          babies simply because it tastes sweet.</p>
        </br>

        <h4 style="text-align:center;text-decoration:underline;">Is Gripe Water Safe?</h4>
          <p>It depends on the specific brand and ingredients.
            You should always ask your doctor for a recommendation
            for gripe water and any other remedy you're thinking of
            giving your baby. Gripe water made with alcohol definitely isn't
            safe, and other formulas, including those labeled "natural" or
            "homeopathic" (depending on where they're made and what's in them),
            contain a variety of other ingredients that may be unsafe or
            untested.Gripe water made with sucrose, while not dangerous,
            might not be the best choice, either, because you don't want to get
            your baby used to being soothed with sugar. So always check with your
            doctor first and ask for a recommendation (and if it doesn’t work,
            let him or her know).And remember, even if you do try gripe water as
            a remedy for digestive troubles with your pediatrician's approval,
            it should never be given in large quantities to a baby or used as a
            dietary substitute. Infants this age should be fed breast milk or
            formula (or a combination of the two) only.</p>
